Its 50MP triple-camera setup ensures great photos, while the 5,400mAh battery supports fast charging. A premium choice for performance and design.","Xiaomi is one of the most popular smartphone manufacturers in the world that garnered the attention of the world with “flagship killer” phones. Like similar companies before it, it gradually shifted to the flagship space itself with a series of phones named after itself. The Xiaomi 15 is the companys flagship offering for the year 2025.<h2><strong>Xiaomi 15 Overview</strong></h2><h3><strong>Snapdragon 8 Elite</strong></h3>As I mentioned earlier, Xiaomi 15 is the first-ever phone to pack the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset inside. Apart from the new naming scheme, this processor comes in the 3nm fabrication, making it the first Qualcomm silicon to have this lithography.Furthermore, the chipset has a new in-house Oryon CPU architecture with two prime and six performance cores. It does not have any efficiency cores, whatsoever. In the meantime, the prime cores clock in at a whopping 4.32GHz, while the performance cores rest at 3.53GHz. For reference, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 peaked at 3.3GHz, which is less than the frequency output of Snapdragon 8 Elite’s weaker cores.All this is to say, the Snapdragon 8 Elite brings a significant performance boost to the Xiaomi 15.<h3><strong>Design and Display</strong></h3>Appearance-wise the Xiaomi 15 does not deviate much from <a href=""https://www.gadgetbytenepal.com/product/xiaomi-14/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">its predecessor</a>. It has the same flat frames with flat edges. The camera island remains in the same position retaining the squircle shape. It is IP64-rated and available in a plethora of colour choices.The regular lineup includes Lilac, Light Green, Black, White, and Bright Silver. The latter looks very unique with its flashy metallic colour and groovy patterns. You can also get the Xiaomi 15 in three limited-edition options clad in leather and encrusted with diamonds. You can choose from Glacier White, Elephant Grey, and Orange shades.On the front, it has a 6.36-inch 8T LTPO OLED display that is curved on the edges. It is surrounded by minimal bezels that are just 1.38 mm thick. Additionally, this screen stretches 1.5K in resolution and offers up to 120Hz refresh rate. Similarly, users get to enjoy a touch sampling rate and a peak brightness of up to 300Hz and 3,200 nits respectively. The Xiaomi 15 is triple TÜV Rheinland certified and is easy on your eyes. Meanwhile, the Xiaomi “Dragon Crystal” Glass adds durability to the screen.<h3><b>Additional Hardware</b></h3>Moving on to additional internal hardware, you can configure the Xiaomi 15 in four different trims. Those being 12GB + 256GB, 12GB + 512GB, 16GB + 512GB, and 16GB + 1TB. The memory in here is an LPDDR5X, while the storage is UFS 4.0. Xiaomi does not mention anything about its patented <a href=""https://www.gizmochina.com/2023/10/29/xiaomi-14-ultraspace-storage-expansion-8gb-extra-256gb-16gb-extra-512gb/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ultra Space</a>, which offers extra storage space in your phone.

Likewise, it can reverse charge other devices wirelessly too. The Xiaomi 15 features a larger heat dissipation unit to keep things cool and smooth.<h3><b>Camera</b></h3>This phone is also stacked in the camera department. It is equipped with three shooters altogether, the main one being a 50MP unit with a Light Hunter 900 sensor underneath. The auxiliary lenses on the Xiaomi 15 are a telephoto lens and an ultrawide snapper — both of 50MP resolution. The former doubles down as a macro shooter as well, capable of getting as close as 10cm.

For ports, it has two USB-A, one USB-C, an HDMI, one combo headphone jack, as well as an ethernet port.The Lenovo V14 G4 (IRU) comes with a 14-inch display of FHD (1,920 x 1,080) resolution with a standard 60Hz refresh rate. Furthermore, there are two display choices IPS and TN. The one available in Nepal is the latter one, which is the poorer option between the two. It can go 250 nits in brightness, covers 45% NTSC colour gamut, and offers a 500:1 contrast ratio. The viewing angles are pretty bad with 45° on either side, 35° from down, and just 15° from up.<h3><strong>Performance</strong></h3>Under the helm, this Lenovo V14 G4 (IRU) variant has a 13th Gen <a href=""https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/232153/intel-core-i51335u-processor-12m-cache-up-to-4-60-ghz/specifications.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Intel Core i5-1335U</a> processor. You can configure this laptop with other Intel and AMD silicon. They are available in Nepal as well. Regardless, this particular silicon has 10 cores, and 12 threads, and reaches a peak clock speed of 4.6GHz. Meanwhile, the integrated Intel Iris Xe handles the graphics side of things.Other than that, it comes with 8GB memory out of the box. It is soldered onto the board. However, the Lenovo V14 G4 (IRU) has dual-channel DDR4-3200 RAM support of up to 16GB. This means you can pop in an extra 8GB of memory whenever you require. For storage, it comes with a 512GB NVMe PCIe 4.0 SSD, which can be doubled when you run out of space. Given that, this laptop offers a decent upgradability unit allowing you to future-proof it.<ul> 	<li><em><strong>Check out <a href=""https://www.gadgetbytenepal.com/cat/laptop/lenovo/"">other Lenovo Laptops</a> in Nepal!</strong></em></li></ul>",Y,http://45.117.153.85:8002/uploads/medias/2024/08/Lenovo-V14-G4-i5-1335U.jpg,44,"Lenovo V14 G4 (Intel i5-1335U, 8GB, 512GB, 14\"" FHD)","Lenovo V14 G4 (IRU) laptop official price, full specifications, and more.

It features dual OLED displays with a 120Hz refresh rate, 3840 PWM dimming, and wide PCI-D3 color gamut. The outer screen is 6.43 inches, while the inner screen expands to 7.92 inches. Powered by a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip, it includes 16GB RAM, 512GB storage, and a 5,000 mAh battery with 66W charging. The camera setup includes a 50MP main, 50MP ultrawide, and 20MP telephoto lens, plus two 16MP selfie cameras.","<div><h2><strong>Honor Magic V3 Overview</strong></h2><h3><strong>Design and Display</strong></h3>Talking of the design, the Honor Magic V3 is a book-style foldable that is as thin as a regular phone. In fact, this thing has been on a diet and lost 0.7mm from its thickness, coming from 9.9mm in the <a href=""https://www.gadgetbytenepal.com/product/honor-magic-v2/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">previous generation</a>. Other than that, its back panel has a leather finish, a large octagonal camera dial, and IPX8 dust and water resistance.The displays on this thing include a larger 7.92-inch folding inner and a 6.43-inch cover screen. Both the panels are LTPO OLED with 1–120Hz refresh rate. Meanwhile, the outer display has a higher PWM dimming at 4,320Hz compared to 3,840Hz of the inner screen. Likewise, the outer display can go as bright as 5,000 nits and dons a Rhino Glass protection. The inner display isn’t entirely naked though, as it is layered with a film which is coated with nano-aluminium oxide. This coating apparently increases the screen’s wear resistance by fivefold, which if true, is absolutely great!<h3><strong>Performance</strong></h3>Under the helm, you get Qualcomm’s 2024 flagship offering — Snapdragon 8 Gen 3. This CPU clocks in at a maximum of 3.3GHz, and is the second most powerful processor <a href=""https://nanoreview.net/en/soc-list/rating"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">per Nanoreview</a>. The Honor Magic V3 is also equipped with an in-house C1+ chip that enhances the phone’s network reception.Additionally, the phone is available in three different configurations. Those being, 12GB + 256GB, 16GB + 512GB, and 16GB + 1TB. It has an independent storage chip with a dual TEE security system as well which ensures the user’s data privacy. The Honor Magic V3 houses a titanium vapour chamber as well, which keeps its temperature in check and smoothes the performance.<h3><b>Camera and Battery</b></h3>The camera department includes three rear shooters and two selfie units. On the back, it has a 50MP primary camera coupled with a 40MP ultrawide shooter and a 50MP periscope telephoto unit. Furthermore, it is capable of 3.5x optical and 100x times digital zoom. Both the inner as well as outer front cameras on the Honor Magic V3 are a 20MP sensor that also handles face recognition.This phone packs a 5,150mAh capacity battery with 66W wired, 50W wireless, and reverse wireless charging support. Though it looks quite modest on paper, it is Honor’s proprietary <a href=""https://www.gadgetbytenepal.com/2nd-gen-silicon-carbon-battery-the-future-of-battery-tech/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">silicon-carbon</a> battery. The company uses bits of silicon in their battery anode resulting in larger power density, faster charging, and tolerance to freezing weather conditions.

This phone also gets the Galaxy AI and 7 years of software updates moving forward. The primary camera and the battery also receive an upgrade at 50MP and 4,000 mAh respectively. Meanwhile, the ultrawide camera, front shooter, and the charging speeds remain the same.","Are you for a phone that is truly unique, but does not cut corners in terms of performance? Then you might want to consider getting the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6.<h2><strong>Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 Overview</strong></h2><h3><strong>Design and Display</strong></h3>The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 is the companys fifth iteration of a clamshell-style foldable (they skipped the Z Flip2 to match numbers with the Z Fold). Aesthetically, this phone looks much more neater than <a href=""https://www.gadgetbytenepal.com/product/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">its predecessor</a>. On this iteration, Samsung is matching the colour of the camera casing with the rest of the phone. Meanwhile, the frame has gone totally flat, dust and water resistance has gone up to IP48 and comes in seven different colours (three of which are online exclusive).The screen department on the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 does not see many changes. Inside, you get the same 6.7-inch Infinity Flex display. It is a Dynamic AMOLED 2X panel with FHD+ resolution and 120Hz refresh rate. The inner screen can glow a lot brighter at 2,600 nits tops. In the meantime, the outer screen is a 3.4-inch Super AMOLED panel with a standard 60Hz refresh rate. Additionally, it has a 720 x 748 pixels resolution and dons a Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 protection. The inner screen does not enjoy any such luxury because it obviously needs to — fold.<h3><strong>Performance and the rest</strong></h3>For performance, this foldable taps into the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor but the one that Qualcomm specifically <a href=""https://www.trustedreviews.com/versus/snapdragon-8-gen-3-for-galaxy-vs-snapdragon-8-gen-3"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">boosted for Galaxy phones</a>. The memory on this thing has gone up to 12GB, which is the only variation available. On the other hand, Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 is available 256GB and 512GB storage options. The phone now has a much-needed vapour chamber, which is the first time for the series. Likewise, the battery capacity has also gone up to 4,000 mAh — a respectable amount.This year the lower member of the series finally gets a camera upgrade. Now the primary shooter on this thing is a 50MP unit, a great leap from the 12MP on previous generations. Likewise, the ultrawide remains at 12MP, but the actual sensor has apparently grown bigger. On the front, it is still the same 10MP shooter. Given its form factor, the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 comes with all the quirky software features. Like every other product this year, <a href=""https://www.gadgetbytenepal.com/samsung-galaxy-ai/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Galaxy AI</a> supercharges this phone as well!

Additionally, it supports charging from both the port and wirelessly.","<h2><b>Samsung Galaxy Buds Overview:</b></h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Okay, let's start with an overview of the Samsung Galaxy Buds.</span><h3><b>Design</b></h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In terms of design, the Galaxy Buds are in-ear wireless earphones with no stem. The earbuds come with three rubber wingtip size options for comfort: small, medium, and large, and weigh only around 6 g. The case is a rectangle-ish-shaped capsule weighing nearly 40 g. It was only available in three color options: black, white, and yellow before Samsung added a new choice, Aura Glow Silver.</span><h3><b>Audio</b></h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Samsung Galaxy Buds equips four mics, two on each earpiece, achieving ambient sound. Ambient sound is a feature of Samsung's earbuds, which enhances the sound from the surroundings to make it clearer to the ears. Moreover, this dual mic setup also enhances your call experience by providing your voice better to the receiver. The codecs supported here are SBC, AAC, and even their own codec, SSC.</span><h3><b>Battery</b></h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For the battery, the Samsung Galaxy Buds can carry 58mAh cells. This battery lasts about 6 hours of typical usage or 5 hours of continuous calling, exclusive of the ambient sound. Additionally, the charging case provides you with around 7 hours of backup, which is mediocre if you compare it to today's TWS.</span><h3><b>Connectivity</b></h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Besides, you can connect Samsung Galaxy Buds with Android and iOS devices. You are required to install Samsung Wearables from the App Store on iOS, though. You can control the buds from the app on <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.samsung.android.app.watchmanager&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=US&amp;pli=1"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Android</a> too, but that is optional. Samsung also introduced ""Connect Shift,"" a between-device connection feature to swap the earbuds between a watch and a phone.</span><h3><b>Others</b></h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Other than that, Samsung provides the accelerometer, hall sensor, and proximity sensor. Bixby is the assistant by default, though you can change it to whichever fits you best. Aside from that, the Galaxy Buds case supports wireless charging that charges from 0 to full in about 1 hour. Alternatively, you can charge it using the USB-C port provided.</span>",Y,http://45.117.153.85:8002/uploads/medias/2023/05/Samsung-Galaxy-Buds-Black.jpg,48,Samsung Galaxy Buds Price and Specifications in Nepal,"Samsung Galaxy Buds' full specifications, price, comparison, and more.

It hovers over your ear canals instead and delivers audio. These kinds of earbuds come in two types: bone conduction and air conduction technology. And this guy follows the latter one. Either way, open ear earbuds cannot block out external noises or in other words, you can hear your outdoors too while listening to music.The audio here is fired by 14mm large drivers but during my testing, the audio quality was just on the average side, nothing extraordinary.

X-Age promises a 6-hour battery life at full volume and a combined playback of 28 hours with the case.

Heres a quick overview.<h2><strong>Realme 12x 5G Overview</strong></h2><h3><strong>Design and Display</strong></h3>Realme 12x 5G keeps the majority of design aspects similar to its predecessor. Except for the shift of the camera island on the back to the center, which puts it more in line with its other members of the Realme 12 series. Moreover, it boasts <a href=""https://www.trustedreviews.com/explainer/what-is-ip54-4253976"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">IP54</a> water and ingress protection while maintaining a slim profile of 7.89mm. This phone ships in two finishes: Twilight Purple and Woodland Green.On the front, you are getting an LCD panel that measures 6.72 inches diagonally. The screen is capable of five levels of refresh rate adjustment peaking at 120Hz. In the meantime, it can get as bright as 950 nits under HBM (High Brightness Mode). Additionally, the Realme 12x 5G also bags the TÜV Rheinland low blue light certification.<h3><b>Performance</b></h3>Moving on to the performance side of things, the latest Realme offering does not offer any upgrade in terms of processor. Meaning, that it sticks with the same <a href=""https://www.mediatek.com/products/smartphones-2/mediatek-dimensity-6100plus"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">MediaTek Dimensity 6100+</a> chipset.

It comes in an 8/128GB trim in Nepal. In addition, you can virtually double the memory while also expanding the storage with a MicroSD card of up to 2TB on the Realme 12x. Furthermore, this phone boots on the Realme UI 5.0 based on Android 14.<h3><b>Camera and the rest</b></h3>In terms of camera, the Realme 12x 5G comes with a primary 50MP shooter — which is a dip from the 64MP you would get on a last-gen phone. However, we all know that the megapixels of the camera do not solely dictate the image quality.Other than that, there’s a 2MP black &amp; white (B&amp;W) camera as well. Meanwhile, you once again get an 8MP camera on the front.

1204,Xiaomi Pad 5,xiaomi-pad-5,"Xiaomi Pad 5 is the company's first tablet in 3 years. Among the three tablets launched in this series so far, only the standard Xiaomi Pad 5 has made its way to the international market including Nepal—whereas the Xiaomi Pad 5 Pro and Pro 5G are still exclusive to China. This tablet brings a powerful processor, an elegant design, a nice display, and a quad-speaker array which means it is capable to handle your everyday chores while being binge-ready as well. Having said that, the Xiaomi Pad 5 doesn't support cellular connectivity so you're restricted to just WiFi connectivity here. The company also sells the official stylus and keyboard accessory for this tablet but as of now, neither of them is available in Nepal.","<h2><strong>Xiaomi Pad 5 Overview:</strong></h2><h3><strong>Design</strong></h3>Xiaomi Pad 5 has a glass-plastic hybrid build quality with aluminum frames. Its plastic back has been topped off with a matte finish that has a great hands-on feel. The tablet is pretty thin at just 6.85mm, while it is pretty heavy weighing a whopping 511 grams. The Pad 5 is available in two color options: Pearl White and Cosmic Gray.<h3><strong>Display</strong></h3>Upfront, you're looking at a large 11"" IPS LCD panel with a sharp 2.5K WQHD resolution. It also enjoys a smooth 120Hz refresh rate alongside a 240Hz touch sampling rate. Besides this, Xiaomi Pad 5's screen has a 10-bit color depth and it is also HDR10 and <a href=""https://www.dolby.com/technologies/dolby-vision/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Dolby Vision</a> certified for HDR playback on streaming platforms like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video.<img src=""http://45.117.153.85:8002/uploads/medias/2021/11/Xiaomi-Pad-5-Display.jpg"" alt=""Xiaomi Pad 5 - Display"" width=""900"" height=""600"" />This display is encased inside minimal bezels on all four sides. But Xiaomi has made sure that the bezels are adequately thick enough to prevent any accidental touches when you're holding the tablet. Moreover, since it bears a 16:10 aspect ratio, the Xiaomi Pad 5's screen doesn't suffer from letterboxes when you're watching videos as much as you would on the <a href=""https://www.gadgetbytenepal.com/ipad-2021-review/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">9th Gen iPad</a>.<h3><strong>Performance</strong></h3>On the performance front, Xiaomi has used Qualcomm's <a href=""https://www.qualcomm.com/products/application/smartphones/snapdragon-8-series-mobile-platforms/snapdragon-855-plus-and-860-mobile-platform"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Snapdragon 860</a> chip here. It has been complemented with 6GB of LPDDR4X RAM and either 128 or 256GB of UFS 3.1 storage. Unfortunately, this tablet doesn't support expandable storage. As far as software goes, it runs on a special fork of MIUI 12.5 called ""MIUI for Pad"" with a handful of tablet-specific features.<h3><strong>Audio</strong></h3>In terms of audio, the Xiaomi Pad 5 has a quad-speaker system with Dolby Atmos tuning. It is also Hi-Res and Hi-Res Wireless certified for a premium audio experience. However, Xiaomi hasn't installed a 3.5mm headphone jack on this tablet.<h3><strong>Battery</strong></h3>Fueling the Xiaomi Pad 5 is a sizeable 8720mAh battery. The company claims 16+ hours of video playback and over 10 hours of gaming here, but under normal usage, you can expect somewhere between 8 – 10 hours of screen-on time. It supports 33W fast charging, while Xiaomi provides a compatible power brick inside the box itself.<img src=""http://45.117.153.85:8002/uploads/medias/2021/11/Xiaomi-Pad-5-Design-2.jpg"" alt=""Xiaomi Pad 5 - Design 2"" width=""900"" height=""600"" /><h3><strong>Others</strong></h3>Finally, the Xiaomi Pad 5 has two cameras in total—one on the front and one at the back. The rear camera uses a 13MP sensor capable of shooting up to 4K 30 fps videos, whereas the 8MP front camera maxes out at 1080p 30 fps recordings. Moving on, this tablet doesn't have cellular connectivity or a built-in navigation (GPS) system.In the international market, Xiaomi Pad 5's official stylus and keyboard accessory are also available, although they haven't made it to Nepal just yet. Security-wise, there's no fingerprint reader here—physical or optical. Overall, considering everything you're getting for the price, the Xiaomi Pad 5 boasts an unbeatable value in the Nepali market.",Y,http://45.117.153.85:8002/uploads/medias/2022/04/Xiaomi-Pad-5-Pearl-White.jpg,39,"Xiaomi Pad 5 Price, Full Specifications, Comparison","Xiaomi Pad 5 price, full specifications, and more.
